Thank you for visiting my website! I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting any data that may be collected. This Privacy Policy explains what information is gathered when you visit this website and how it is used.

## Hosting and Content Delivery

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages, a static hosting platform provided by GitHub Inc., with content served through Cloudflare's content delivery network (CDN) and domain management services. This setup provides enhanced performance, security, and reliability through:

- **GitHub Pages**: Static site hosting with global edge locations
- **Cloudflare**: CDN, DNS management, security services, and SSL/TLS termination
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All traffic is encrypted in transit using TLS

## Data Collection

This is a static website with no server-side processing, user accounts, comment systems, contact forms, or interactive features. I do not directly collect, store, or process any personal information. However, certain data may be processed by the third-party services that power this website:

### GitHub Pages
- **Data Collected**: Basic server logs including IP addresses, user agents, referrer URLs, timestamps, and requested pages
- **Purpose**: Service delivery, security monitoring, and abuse prevention
- **Retention**: As per GitHub's data retention policies
- **Privacy Policy**: [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)

### Cloudflare
- **Data Collected**: IP addresses, request headers, cache performance metrics, security threat data, and basic analytics
- **Purpose**: Content delivery optimization, DDoS protection, security filtering, and performance analytics
- **Retention**: Varies by data type (typically 30 days for logs, longer for aggregated analytics)
- **Privacy Policy**: [Cloudflare Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)

## Cookies and Local Storage

This website does not set any first-party cookies or use local storage. However:

- **Cloudflare** may set essential cookies for security purposes, performance optimization, and bot detection (such as `__cflb`, `__cf_bm`, `cf_clearance`)
- These cookies are necessary for the proper functioning and security of the website
- You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings, though disabling certain cookies may affect site functionality

## Analytics and Tracking

This website does not use Google Analytics, social media tracking pixels, advertising networks, or any other third-party analytics or tracking services beyond what is inherently provided by GitHub Pages and Cloudflare for operational purposes.

## Third-Party Links and Content

This site may contain links to external websites, resources, or services. I am not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites. Please review their respective privacy policies when visiting external links.

## Data Security

Security measures in place include:

- **HTTPS/TLS Encryption**: All data in transit is encrypted
- **Cloudflare Security**: DDoS protection, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and bot management
- **Static Site Architecture**: Minimal attack surface with no server-side processing or databases
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and platform components are kept up to date

While these measures provide strong protection, no method of internet transmission is 100% secure.

## International Data Transfers

Both GitHub and Cloudflare operate globally. Your data may be processed in countries other than where you are located. Both services implement appropriate safeguards for international data transfers in compliance with applicable privacy laws.

## Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding data processing, including:

- Right to access information about data processing
- Right to request deletion of personal data
- Right to object to certain processing activities

Since I do not directly collect or control personal data, such requests should be directed to:
- **GitHub**: Through their privacy contact methods
- **Cloudflare**: Through their privacy portal

## Legal Basis for Processing

Data processing by third-party services is based on:
- **Legitimate interests**: For security, performance, and service delivery
- **Necessity**: For providing the website service you requested
- **Compliance**: With legal obligations for security and abuse prevention

## Data Retention

I do not retain any user data myself. Data retention by third-party services:
- **GitHub Pages**: Per GitHub's data retention schedule
- **Cloudflare**: Typically 30 days for detailed logs, longer for aggregated data

## Children's Privacy

This website does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). The content is general-purpose and not specifically directed at children.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in:
- Website functionality or services used
- Legal requirements
- Privacy practices

Material changes will be indicated by updating the "last modified" date at the top of this page.
