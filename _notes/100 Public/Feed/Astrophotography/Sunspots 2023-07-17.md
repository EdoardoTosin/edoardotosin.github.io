On July 17, 2023, there were six active sunspot regions visible on the Earth-facing side of the Sun, including notable regions **AR3363**, **AR3372**, and **AR3373**.[^1] In visible light, these sunspots appear as dark spots against the bright solar surface.
While the visible light image highlights sunspot regions, significant solar activity occurred over the previous 24 hours:
- **AR3363**, near the Sunâ€™s western limb, produced an M4.0-class flare at 17:36 UT, causing an R1 (minor) radio blackout over the sunlit side of Earth.[^1]
- A total of 20 C-class flares were also recorded, with **AR3373** contributing the most activity despite its relatively simple structure.[^1]
- An unnumbered region on the southeast limb of the Sun showed signs of potential future activity.[^1]

Although the visible image does not directly reveal coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or filament eruptions, these events occurred alongside visible sunspot activity.
