## Hi there!

I'm Edoardo Tosin from Italy. I love computer science and a lot of its branches.

My personal interests include Osint, Infosec.

My recent project are:
- [miniLaska Game](https://github.com/EdoardoTosin/miniLaska-Game): a simple CLI based cross-platform game written in C
- [ZooMeeting Redirector](https://github.com/EdoardoTosin/ZooMeeting-Redirector): web extension for Chrome, Firefox and Edge that redirects Zoom meetings to the web client page.
- [Batch Image Converter](https://github.com/EdoardoTosin/Batch-Image-Converter): python script that convert all images in the same directory to jpg (except png and jpeg) and by default downscales them to 1000 pixel long side and set the dpi to 72 or can accept arguments in input to set custom values.
