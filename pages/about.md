### About Me

I'm {{ site.author }}, a computer science graduate based in Italy.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Digital Business and Information Technology. My interests span cybersecurity, software development, and data analysis, where I enjoy building practical solutions and exploring new challenges.

I contribute to digital security through independent vulnerability research and responsible disclosure. My work has been recognized by the [BSI Hall of Fame](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/IT-Sicherheitsvorfall/IT-Schwachstellen/Hall_of_Fame/Hall_of_Fame_node.html) (Germany's Federal Office for Information Security) for reporting security vulnerabilities that help protect critical infrastructure.

### Areas of Expertise

- **Cybersecurity**: Security analysis, vulnerability research, and responsible disclosure.
- **Software Development**: C, Python, and web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for building CLI tools, browser extensions, and automation scripts.
- **Data Analysis**: Geospatial and satellite imagery processing for environmental and scientific applications.

### What This Site Offers

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Technical articles, research notes, and tutorials on security, software development, and related topics.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world applications demonstrating problem-solving approaches in cybersecurity, software engineering, and data analysis.
