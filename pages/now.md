Hunting for security vulnerabilities through bug bounty programs in my free time and preparing responsible disclosures when issues are found. Recently, one of my reports was addressed and recognized on the [BSI - Hall of Fame](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/IT-Sicherheitsvorfall/IT-Schwachstellen/Hall_of_Fame/Hall_of_Fame_node.html).

Keeping up with cybersecurity and network security topics—reading about new vulnerabilities, exploring FOSS security tools, and following industry news.
