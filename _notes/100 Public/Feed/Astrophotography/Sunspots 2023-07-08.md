On July 8, 2023, sun activity was relatively low, with 11 C-class solar flares recorded over 24 hours.[^1] The most active region of the day was **AR3361**, which produced the largest flare, a C4.2, at 1:44 UTC.[^1] Despite the overall calm, three sunspot regions were prominent and of particular interest in the visible spectrum:
- **AR3363**: The largest sunspot region, easily visible in this image.
- **AR3361**: A highly active region in the northeast, responsible for several flares.
- **AR3366**: A large and distinct region located in the southwest quadrant.
